	<h1>Lab Assignment # 2</h1>
	<h2>Question 1: What area do you want to depict in your map? Why?</h2>
	<p>I am going to depict the Albuquerque area in my map so that I can show my
	favorite places to visit in Albuquerque.</p>
	<h2>Question 2: What is the center point (latitude and longitude) of your area of interest?</h2>
	<p>The center point I am using is 35.1107, -106.6100 </p>
	<h2>Question 3: What style of map (roads, satellite, hybrid, terrain) is appropriate for your map? Why?</h2>
	<p>I think that a roadmap is most appropriate for my project because most people would need to
	locate the places according to the roads in order to visit the same place themselves. </p>
	<h2>Question 4: What is the scale of your map (local, regional, continental, global)?
	How will this translate into your selection of an appropriate default zoom level for your map?</h2>
	<p> The scale of my map is local because I will be showing the names of roads and specific locations
	within the city. I think that zoom level 9 will be appropriate for my map.
