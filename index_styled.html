                <p><strong>About me:</strong> My name is Christina Hoberg. I am originally from Seattle, WA but moved to the Albuquerque
                        area 4 years ago because me husband is from here. Luckily, I enjoy visiting new places! I think 
                        Albuquerque is a really unique cultural and environmental area. I am a Geography and Environmental Science
                        major at UNM, with a minor in Sustainability Studies. I hope my education will lead me to a career
                        that can help humans modify our cities and homes to be biologically-sound for us and the planet.
